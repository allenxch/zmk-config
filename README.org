#+Title: allenxch's ferris sweep zmk-config

Original config forked from [[https://github.com/sky-bro/zmk-config/][sky-bro's zmk-config]].
However, I took a different approach to the symbol layer and modifiers.

** Flashing ZMK Firmware Tutorial

1. [[https://github.com/allenxch/zmk-config/fork][fork]] this repo and/or download firmware.zip from github Actions.
   Unzip it to find the firmware files.
2. Connect half to the computer with a usbc data transfer cable.
3. Press the =&bootloader= key on the keyboard(know your keymap).
   Press the reset button twice if needed.
4. Mount your nicenano. If it does not show up, check your =dmesg= and =lsblk=, then mount it manually with =mount=.
5. copy the corresponding file to the directory mounted on.
6. Do steps 2-5 for the other half if this is your first time flashing. If not, you only need to flash the master side(left).

** Config and Keymap
    - For specifics please check the files.

*** Base Layer
    - QWERTY with no extra behaviour to ensure smooth vim experience.

*** Number and Symbol Layer
    - Numners on the top row.
    - Additional symbols are accessed with shift.
    - Left Modifiers.

*** Utility Layer
    - F keys.
    - Useful system functions.
    - Right Modifiers.

*** Gaming / Mouse Layer
    - Toggle this layer with a combo of both layer keys.
    - The left half is essentially a one-handed gaming keyboard.
    - The right half is a virtual mouse mimicked with hjkl movement keys.

*** Bluetooth Profiles management and Keyboard management Layer
