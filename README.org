4. Mount your nicenano. If it does not show up, check your =dmesg= and =lsblk=, then mount it manually with =mount=.
5. copy the corresponding file to the directory mounted on.
6. Do steps 2-5 for the other half if this is your first time flashing. If not, you only need to flash the master side(left).
